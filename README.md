Description of the Game Arcade Website
Overview:
The game arcade website is designed as an interactive platform hosting three classic games: Snake, Balloon Pop, and 2048. Each game has been carefully integrated into the site with a consistent visual theme and responsive design to ensure an engaging user experience across various devices.

Games and Rules:

Snake Game
Objective: Control a growing snake to consume items randomly appearing on the screen. Each item consumed makes the snake longer.
Gameplay: Use arrow keys to navigate the snake around the play area. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail.

Balloon Pop Game
Objective: Pop as many rising balloons as possible before they escape off the top of the screen.
Gameplay: Click on the balloons to pop them and earn points.

2048 Game
Objective: Combine tiles with the same numbers to form a tile with the number 2048.
Gameplay: Swipe (or use arrow keys) to move and merge tiles in the desired direction.

Technical Challenges and Modifications:

Open-Source Modifications: While integrating open-source code for the 2048 game, challenges included adapting the codebase to fit the unified aesthetic and ensuring compatibility with the existing site architecture.
JavaScript Adjustments: The primary JavaScript challenge was to refactor and optimize event handlers and game logic to enhance performance and maintainability without altering the core gameplay mechanics.
CSS Integration: Uniformly styling each game to match the arcade's visual theme required careful tweaks to CSS, ensuring responsive layouts across devices without disrupting game mechanics.
JavaScript for Enhanced Navigation:

Purpose: To facilitate easy navigation between games using keyboard inputs, enhancing the user experience, especially for users without touch screens.

Functionality: The JavaScript enables users to cycle through game links using arrow keys and start a game with the Enter key, simulating a more interactive and accessible game console environment.
